- Predicting a Startups Profit/Success Rate using Multiple Linear Regression in Python
- Here 50 startups dataset containing 5 columns  like `R&D Spend`, `Administration`, `Marketing Spend`, `State` and `Profit`.
- The first 3 columns indicate how much each startup spends on Research and Development, how much they spend on Marketing, and how much they spend on administration cost, the state column indicates which state the startup is based in, and the last column states the profit made by the startup.
- It is a multiple linear regression problem, as the independent variables are more than one.
- Prepare a prediction model for profit of 50_Startups data in Python
